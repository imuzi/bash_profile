## Get started

Clone this project in your home folder `~`.

```sh
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/marcomontalbano/bash_profile.git
```

Open and modify your `$HOME/.bash_profile` on OS X and Windows or `$HOME/.bashrc` on Ubuntu, adding the following script.

```sh
#Â https://github.com/marcomontalbano/bash_profile
source ~/bash_profile/.bash_profile -u
```

### Options

- `-p <http-proxy>`: combined with `-u`, you can use self-update behind proxy.
- `-u`: enables self-update for bash_profile. (the latest release will automatically downloaded and loaded)
- `-w`: show welcome screen on new tabs.


## Completions

The following procedure works for OS X. If you are using Windows or Ubuntu, you don't need it. 

If you want to use the git, svn and ssh completion, just run following scripts.

```sh
# Bash Completion for GIT
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash -o ~/bash_profile/.bash_completion_git

# Bash Completion for SVN
curl http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/tools/client-side/bash_completion -o ~/bash_profile/.bash_completion_svn

# Bash Completion for SSH and SFTP
curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/marcomontalbano/7c48f6756e4e4133c30fdb8e1fff3100/raw -o ~/bash_profile/.bash_completion_ssh
```
